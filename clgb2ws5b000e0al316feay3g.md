**Definition**: Arranging Computers in a network.

There are various types of topology. Some of them are listed below:

1. **BUS TOPOLOGY.**

    This is an image for Bus topology.
    
    1\. It is Bi-directional.
    
    2\. It is Multipoint.
    
    3\. Used in Cable Television.
    
2. **STAR TOPOLOGY.**

    If the central device is a hub then -&gt; Broadcast.
    
    If the central device is a switch then -&gt; Unicast.
    
3. **RING TOPOLOGY.**

    This is an image for Ring Topology.
    
    This is a uni-directional topology.
    

There are also Mesh and Hybrid Topology. These we will discuss in the next Blog.
